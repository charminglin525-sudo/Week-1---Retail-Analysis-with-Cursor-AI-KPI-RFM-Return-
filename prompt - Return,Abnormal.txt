1.1 In 彙總表 Load Normal Order/Abnormal Order/Return Order tabs.

2.1 In the Return Order data:
   - Calculate total return amount and return count per StockCode (returned quantity / total sold quantity).

2.2 Merge with Normal Order revenue data to calculate overall return rate:
   Compute return frequency per StockCode.
   - Return_Rate: -Return_Amount / (-Return_Amount + Revenue)
   - Return_Frequency: Return_Count / (Return_Count + Normal_Count

give tag by different situation
   - High-return items: Return_Rate > 0.7 and Return_Count > 5
   - Medium-return items: 0.7 >= Return_Rate > 0.3
   - Low-return items: 0.3 >= Return_Rate
   - 100% return items(outlier): Return_Count =< 5

3.1 In the Return Order data:
   - Calculate total return amount and return count per CustomerID (returned quantity / total sold quantity).

3.2 Merge with Normal Order revenue data to calculate overall return rate:
   Compute return frequency per CustomerID.
   - Return_Rate: -Return_Amount / (-Return_Amount + Revenue)
   - Return_Frequency: Return_Count / (Return_Count + Normal_Count


give tag by different situation
   - High-return customer: Return_Rate > 0.7 and Return_Count > 5
   - Medium-return customer: 0.7 >= Return_Rate > 0.3
   - Low-return customer: 0.3 >= Return_Rate
   - 100% return customer(outlier): Return_Count =< 5

put 2.2 into "Return analysis product" tab

put 3.2 into "Return analysis customer" tab

4.1 Calculate Return_Rate(Amount) and Return_Frequency(Count) by Country
put 4.1 into "Return analysis country" tab


5.1 In the Abnormal Order data:
   - Count and calculate the proportion of missing CustomerID and missing Description and add-up two count by Stockcode and Country.
put 5.1 into "Abnormal analysis product" tab

6.1 Generate insights:
   - List "High-return items" 
   - List "High-return customer" 
   - List top 10 Country based on the Return_Rate (higher the top)
   - List top 10 Products based on the missing count (higher the top)
